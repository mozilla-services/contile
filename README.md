## Why "Contile"?

It's a portmanteau of "Context" and "Tile", which turns out to be the name of [a small village](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Contile/@44.6503701,9.9015688,3a,15y,40.52h,87.97t/data=!3m10!1e1!3m8!1shPkpksIO5_yiJpqYALgcNQ!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DhPkpksIO5_yiJpqYALgcNQ%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D8.469731%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656!9m2!1b1!2i22!4m5!3m4!1s0x47808736ea28b80d:0xd17ee6c4205c4451!8m2!3d44.650751!4d9.902755) in the Parma region of Italy. So it's pronounced "[kon **tē`** lā](https://translate.google.com/?sl=it&tl=en&text=contile&op=translate)"
