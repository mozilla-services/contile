    description: Test that Contile returns a 204 No Content for excluded regions
    # This test uses the Environment Flag "CONTILE_EXCLUDED_COUNTRIES_200" (specified
    # in the `docker-compose.204.yml` file) and checks that Contile returns a 204 with
    # no content if a request is made to an excluded country location.
    steps:
      - request:
          method: GET
          path: '/v1/tiles'
          headers:
            # Contile maps the User-Agent Header value to os-family and form-factor parameters
            # The following value will result in os-family: macos and form-factor: desktop
            - name: User-Agent
              value: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0'
            # Contile looks up the IP address from this header value and maps it to proxy information.
            # We use a random IP address from the range specified by the CIDR network notation "89.160.20.112/28"
            # from https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB/blob/main/source-data/GeoLite2-City-Test.json
            # The following value will result in country-code: SE and region-code: E
            - name: X-Forwarded-For
              value: '89.160.20.115'
        response:
